# Project Name: HW1

## Overview
This project implements the LeNet-5 architecture over the FashionMNIST dataset and compares the effects of different regularization techniques:
- **Dropout** (at the hidden layer)
- **Weight Decay** (L2 regularization)
- **Batch Normalization**

The project includes scripts for training the model, generating convergence graphs, and comparing the techniques.
